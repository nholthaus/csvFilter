THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

When complete, csvFilter will allow a user to perform advanced sorting and filtering on csv files using other csv files or the powerful in-gui filtering tools.

Right now, it does just about nothing. Stay tuned for the initial release, planned for sometime in the next few weeks.

This program is dedicated to my lovely wife Carmen, for whom it was designed. The puppy icon was all her idea!
